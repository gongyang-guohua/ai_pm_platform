Sending request to Google Gemini (via google-genai SDK)...

Response from Gemini:
--------------------
Hello! As an AI model trained by Google, I am fully compatible with the latest versions of the **Gemini API SDKs** (such as the `google-generativeai` Python library, the Node.js SDK, and the Vertex AI SDKs).

If you are using the new SDK features¡ªsuch as **System Instructions**, **JSON Mode**, **Function Calling**, or **Controlled Generation (Schema)**¡ªI am designed to support and follow those parameters.

Are you working on a specific implementation or running into an issue with one of the new SDK features? I'd be happy to help you with code snippets or troubleshooting.
--------------------
Connection Successful!
